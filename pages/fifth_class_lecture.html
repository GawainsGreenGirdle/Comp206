        <h2>How to make links in HTML</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>A link is made using the &lta&gt tag (anchor)</li>
           <li>a link knows where it is going with a "href='link'" attribute in the anchor element</li>
           <ul>
                <li>Ex. &lta href = https://www.wikipedia.com&gt</li>
           </ul>
           <li>the "target" attribute specifies where the new page will be open. target ="_blank" opens it in a new window. target="_self" (default) opens it in the current window.</li>
           <li>the "rel" attribute stands for "relation." Two common values "noopener noreferrer" are useful for links.</li>
           <ul>
                <li>"noopener" prevents the new tab from interacting with the original page.</li>
                <li>"noreferrer" prevents the new tab from seeing where you were routed from.</li>
           </ul>
           <li>An abosulte link has a scheme://domain/path</li>
           <li>A relative link doesn't need a scheme or a domain. Instead, it looks a lot like the way a folder is navigated in linux.</li>
           <ul>
                <li>Adding ./ before your path tells the directory that you are travelling relative to your current domain.</li>
           </ul> 
        </ol>
