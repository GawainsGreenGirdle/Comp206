        <h2>How to make links in HTML</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>A link is made using the &lta&gt tag (anchor)</li>
           <li>a link knows where it is going with a "href='link'" attribute in the anchor element</li>
           <ul>
                <li>Ex. &lta href = https://www.wikipedia.com&gt</li>
           </ul>
           <li>the "target" attribute specifies where the new page will be open. target ="_blank" opens it in a new window. target="_self" (default) opens it in the current window.</li>
           <li>the "rel" attribute stands for "relation." Two common values "noopener noreferrer" are useful for links.</li>
           <ul>
                <li>"noopener" prevents the new tab from interacting with the original page.</li>
                <li>"noreferrer" prevents the new tab from seeing where you were routed from.</li>
           </ul>
           <li>An abosulte link has a scheme://domain/path</li>
           <li>A relative link doesn't need a scheme or a domain. Instead, it looks a lot like the way a folder is navigated in linux.</li>
           <ul>
                <li>Adding ./ before your path tells the directory that you are travelling relative to your current domain.</li>
           </ul> 
        </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>git clone URL [DIR] creates DIR directory and clones the repository into the directory</li>
                    <li>git pull fetches the newest updates.</li>
                    <li>git push uploads your commits from the local repo to the remote repo.</li>

            <ol type = "A">
                <li>Program vs. Process: A process is an instance of a program.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>by default, a program will open stdin, stdout, and stderr.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>The standard streams</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>FD 0 is the standard input stdin</li>
                    <li>FD 1 is called standard output stdout</li>
                    <li>FD 2 is called standard error, stderr</li>
                    <li>stds can be transferred to a standard file through <i>redirection</i></li>
                    <li>Redirection</li>
                    <ol type = "a">
                        <li>A single &lt redirects the output to a file. Ex. <code>$ command > output.txt</code> sends the output for the command to the file output.txt</li>
                        <li>A double &lt "&lt&lt" redirects to output to a file and appends it to the file. Ex. <code>$ command &lt&lt output.txt</code> appends the output for the command to the end of the file output.txt</li>
                        <li>Placing a 1 or 2 in front of the bracket will change whether the sterr or stout is being redirected.</li>
                        <li>A &gt can be used to redirect a file to be used as input. Ex. <code>$ command &gt input.txt</code> inputs the values of input.txt to the command</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Piping</li>
                    <ol type = "a">
                        <li>Piping uses the symbol "|"</li>
                        <li>the output from one program is sent as input to the next program.</li>
                        <li>Ex. ls -la | less presents a paginate list of files </li>
                        <li><code>Ex. ls -a pages | head -n3</code> creates a list of the first three files in pages/</li>
