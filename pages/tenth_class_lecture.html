                    <li>Because x-- happens after a comparison or operation, you can write <code>while(x-- > 0)</code> to condense functions.</li>
                    <li><code>scanf("%", &n)</code> is the best way to get input. You can place text before the % to output a prompt.</li>
                    <li>When you ignore a warning, it will act unexpectedly (even though it will work).</li>
                    <li><code>&n</code> is really the <i>pointer</i> of the variable in memory, not the variable value.</li>

                    <li>Write a bash script that uses gcc on a file and then runs the program.</li>
                    <li>You can change the name of the a.out file with the option "-o" and the name you want to use.</li>
